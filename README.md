# 🤖 CareBot – AI Health Symptom Checker

This is an Agentic AI project built using IBM watsonx.ai and Granite models as part of the IBM AICTE Virtual Internship 2025.

## 🩺 Project Overview

This shows how CareBot responds to a user’s symptom query. The agent identifies possible causes, gives self-care tips, and advises when to see a doctor — all in a friendly, non-diagnostic, and easy-to-understand tone.

The agent provides a list of safe home remedies for a headache, including rest, hydration, and stress relief. It also includes a safety disclaimer advising the user to see a doctor if symptoms are severe or unusual.
